# Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a
one-or-two page advance reading to be shared with the other attendees
on either:

- A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
- A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

These advance readings can indicate what topics you're interested in and can also help to shape the week's discussion by suggesting topics of interest or even potential solutions.

If you will be attending Rebooting the Web of Trust October 2024 in Ventura, please upload your advance readings to this directory with a
pull request.

## Pull Request Submission

To add a paper, create a pull request to this repo with your
contribution (preferably as an .md file, but if you can't, as a PDF),
along with updates to the README.md in this folder. Please also
include a byline with contact information in the paper itself.

Please also enter your paper _twice_ in this README file, once in the
topical listing (adding a new category describing your topic, if
necessary) and one in the alphabetical listing. Please be sure to
include the full URL for your paper in the README, so that we can copy
it to the main page URL and have it still correctly link.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, please instead submit an issue.
